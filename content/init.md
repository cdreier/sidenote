nice to see you here!

TODO: add more description

## shortcuts / interactions

* ctrl + n: start new document
* ctrl + s: save the current document
* ctrl + v: paste - not THAT new feature, but you can also paste image data - it gets converted automatically and is uploaded
* if you paste a link, it is pasted as markdown link
* you can also drag & drop files in the editor, it is inserted at the current cursor position
* to stay compatible with markdown, assets are also inserted as link, the editor should take care of everything
* for convinience, some characters, like brackets or quotes are wrapping selected words

please note: every document needs a title, and the title is set by the markdown h1 headline, like in this document in the very first line

## labels

you can use labels in your document to group content together, just like @demo

## links between documents

when you start typing between double brackets (`[[link]]`) you spin of the full text search. When a result is selected, a link line is generated and you can see the linked document in the sidebar.

## the minimap

when documents are linked, you see all relations in the minimap on the lower right corner. Clicking on a blue dot, always opens the content in a new editor to quickly edit linked documents.
